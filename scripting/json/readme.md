## What is it?

JS - Javascript <br>
O - Object <br>

JSON is a syntax used for exchanging data between
a browser/client and server

Popular because it is considered system agnostic.
Doesn't really matter what the two systems are written in.
Both can exchange JSON.

## JSON syntax

Data is name/value pairs:

```
"Name":"Value"
```

Curly Braces hold objects:

```
{"Name":"Value"}
```

Data can be separated by commas,

```
{"Name1":"Value1", "Name2":"Value2"}
```

Square brackets can be used for arrays (lists of data):

```
{"Name":["Value1", "Value2"]}
```
