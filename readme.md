### *Why is it particularly popular for DevOps engineers?* 
Python is very beginner friendly, versatile and has a large community. This is what makes it one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is great for automation and scripting therefore it's popularity among DevOps engineers is easy to understand. its ease of use, readability, and extensive libraries for automation, configuration management, and infrastructure as code tasks make it an appaling option as well as the fact that tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Terraform have extensive Python libraries and integrations.
## *What is a virtual environment or venv?*
A virtual environment (often abbreviated as venv) is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, as well as a set of additional packages. It allows developers to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects.

- os
- sys
- math 
- random
- datetime
- json
```
